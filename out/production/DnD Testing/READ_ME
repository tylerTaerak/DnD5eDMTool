================================================


Things to look at again:

Multiattack on Beholderkin

Redo the entire Monster class to better fit the effects and reword individual effects
as needed to fit in with that

Figure out how to add in expertise

Figure out how to add different multiattack options

Make condition for passives length of 0 (& LegendaryActions)

Figure out how to add variant critical hit rules for specific monsters (see Balor)

Add an if possible clause on multiattack (see nalfeshnee)

Add a method to integrate multiple damage types & rolls in a single attack

Templates

Alternate way to use dragons (rather than just inputting a different stat block for each age)

Adding variants

I could probably add in rarity of finding a monster in a place in the text files

Figure out how to not roll health for a monster until it's added to an encounter

Different ranges for thrown weapons etc

Optional Variants

Better Formatting (\t \n etc) in long strings

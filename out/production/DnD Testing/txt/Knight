======= Passives ===========
Brave: The knight has advantage on saving throws against being frightened
Leadership (recharges after a short or long rest): As an action, for 1 minute, the knight can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 ft of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the knight. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. this effect ends if the knight is incapacitated
Parry: As a reaction, the knight adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the knight must see that attacker and be wielding a melee weapon

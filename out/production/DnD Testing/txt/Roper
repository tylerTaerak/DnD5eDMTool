========= Passives ============
False Appearance: While the roper remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal cave formation, such as a stalagmite
Grasping Tendrils: The roper can have up to six tendrils at a time. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the roper, which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn. A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 15 Strength check against it
Spider Climb: The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check
Reel: As part of its Multiattack or as an action, the roper pulls each creature grappled by it up to 25 ft straight toward it

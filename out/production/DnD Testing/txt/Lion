========== Passives =========
Keen Smell: The lion has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell
Pack Tactics: The lion has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the lion's allies is within 5 ft of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated
Pounce: If the lion moves at least 20 ft straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the lion can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action
Running Leap: With a 10-ft running start, the lion can long jump up to 25 ft

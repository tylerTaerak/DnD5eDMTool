Legendary Resistance (3/day): If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead
Change Shape: As an action, the dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form

Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. The tracks lea to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed
Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the desert sands within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it
Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 ft of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence and location

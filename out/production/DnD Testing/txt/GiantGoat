========= Passives =======
Charge: If the goat moves at least 20 ft straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone
Sure-Footed: The goat has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone

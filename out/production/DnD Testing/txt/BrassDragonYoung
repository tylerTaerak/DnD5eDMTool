------------ regionalEffects -----------
Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. The tracks lea to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain undisturbed
Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the desert sands within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These illusions move and appear real, although they do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any physical interaction with an image reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it
Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within 30 ft of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, the dragon becomes aware of the creature's presence and location
-------------- Lair ---------------
A ruin, canyon or cave network with areas of sunlight

Damage Resistances: cold; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons that aren't silvered
Damage Immunities: fire, poison
Condition Immunities: poisoned
Shapechanger: The imp can use its action to polymorph into a beast form that resembles a rat (speed 20 ft), a raven (20 ft, fly 60 ft), or a spider (20 ft, climb 20 ft), or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for the speed changes noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies
Devil's Sight: Magical darkness doesn't impede the imp's darkvision
Magic Resistance: The imp has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects
Invisibility: As an action, the imp magically turns invisible until it attacks or until its concentration ends( as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the imp wears or carries is invisible with it

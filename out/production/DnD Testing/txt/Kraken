=============== Passives ==============
Damage Immunities: lightning; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons
Condition Immunities: frightened, paralyzed
Amphibious: The kraken can breathe air and water
Freedom of Movement: The kraken ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spends 5 ft of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled
Siege Monster: The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures
Fling: One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken is thrown up to 60 ft in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 ft it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving thrown or take the same damage and be knocked prone. This ability can be used in place of a Tentacle attack during the kraken's Multiattack
=========== Attacks 1 1 1 =================
Attack Bite 18 5 3 8 10 piercing String{ If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns. If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 ft of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 ft of movement, exiting prone }

String{ Ink Cloud } 3 String{ While underwater, the kraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-ft radius.

Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damge on a successful one.

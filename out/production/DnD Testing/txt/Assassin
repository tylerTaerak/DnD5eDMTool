======== Passives ========
Damage Resistances: poison
Assassinate: During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the assassin scores against a suprised creature is a critical hit
Evasion: If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails
Sneak Attack (1/turn): The assassin deals an extra 13 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 ft of an ally of the assassin that isn't incapacitated and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll

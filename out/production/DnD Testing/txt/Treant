=========== Passives ==========
Damage Vulnerabilities: fire
Damage Resistances: bludgeoning, piercing
False Appearance: While the treant remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal tree
Siege Monster: The treant deals double damage to objects and structures
Animate Trees (1/day): As an action, the treant magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60 ft of it. These trees have the same statistics as a treant, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they only have the Slam attack option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more than 120 ft from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible

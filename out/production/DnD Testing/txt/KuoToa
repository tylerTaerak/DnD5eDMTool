Otherworldly Perception: The kuo-toa can sense the presence of any creature within 30 ft of it that is invisible or on the Ethereal Plane. It can pinpoint such a creature that is moving
Slippery: The kuo-toa has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple
Sunlight Sensitivity: While in sunlight, the kuo-toa has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight
Sticky Shield: As a reaction, when a creature misses the kuo-toa with a melee weapon attack, the kuo-toa uses its sticky shield to catch the weapon. The attacker must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw, or the weapon becomes stuck to the kuo-toa's shield. If the weapon's wielder can't or won't let go of the weapon, the wielder is grappled while the weapon is stuck. While stuck, the weapon can't be used. A creature can pull the weapon free by taking an action to make a DC 11 Strength check and succeeding

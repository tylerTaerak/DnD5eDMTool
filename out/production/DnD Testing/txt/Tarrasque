Damage Immunities: fire, poison; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons
Condition Immunities: charmed, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned
Legendary Resistance (3/day): If the tarrasque fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead
Magic Resistance: The tarrasque has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects
Reflective Carapace: Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a magic missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the tarrasque, turning the caster into the target
Siege Monster: The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures
Swallow: As an action or instead of using its Bite attack in its Multiattack, the tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque's turns. If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 ft of movement, exiting prone

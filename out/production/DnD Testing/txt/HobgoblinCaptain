============ Passives =============
Martial Advantage: Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 10 (3d6) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 ft of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn't incapacitated
Leadership (recharges after a short or long rest): As an action, for 1 minute, the hobgoblin can utter a special commmand or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 ft of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. the creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the hobgoblin. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the hobgoblin is incapacitated

========== Passives =========
Distress Spores: When the myconid takes damage, all other myconids within 240 ft of it can sense its pain
Sun Sickness: While in sunlight, the myconid has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The myconid dies if it spends more than 1 hour in direct sunlight
Rapport Spores (3/day): As an action, a 10-ft radius of spores extends from the myconid. These spores can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that aren't undead, constructs or elementals. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 ft of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour

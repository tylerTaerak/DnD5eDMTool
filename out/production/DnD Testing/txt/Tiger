Keen Smell: The tiger has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell
Pounce: If the tiger moves at least 20 ft straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the tiger can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action

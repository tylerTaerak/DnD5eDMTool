Antimagic Cone: The beholder's central eye creates an area of antimagic, as in the antimagic field spell, in a 150-ft cone. At the start of each of its turns, the beholder decides which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the beholder's own eye rays

------------------------ regionalEffects --------------------
Creatures within 1 mile of the beholder's lair sometimes feel as if they're being watched when they aren't
When the beholder sleeps, minor warps in reality occur within 1 mile of its lair and then vanish 24 hours later. Marks on cave walls might change subtly, an eerie trinket might appear where none existed before, harmless slime might coat a statue, and so on. These effects apply only to natural surfaces and to nonmagical objects that aren't on anyone's person
------------------------ Lair -------------------------
Large, spacious caverns with high ceilings

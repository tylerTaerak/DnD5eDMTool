============ Passives ============
Keen Sight: The nothic has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight
Weird Insight: As an action, the nothic targets one creature it can see within 30 ft of it. The target must contest its Charisma (Deception) check against the nothic's Wisdom (Insight) check. If the nothic wins, it magically learns one fact or secret about the target. The target automatically wins if it is immune to being charmed

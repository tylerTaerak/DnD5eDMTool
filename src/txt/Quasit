================== Passives ================
Damage Resistances: cold, fire, lightning; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons
Damage Immunities: poison
Condition Immunities: poisoned
Shapechanger: The quasit can use its action to polymorph into a beast form that resembles a bat (speed 10 ft, fly 40 ft), a centipede (40 ft, climb 40 ft), or a toad (40 ft, swim 40 ft), or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for the speed changes noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies
Magic Resistance: The quasit has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects
Invisibility: As an action, the quasit magically turns invisible until it attacks or uses Scare, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the quasit wears or carries is invisible with it

The wall can alternatively be a hemispherical dome up to 20 ft in diameter. When the wall appears, the creatures in its space are pushed out (the creature chooses which side, unless incapacitated), and takes damage. The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-ft section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes } Dexterity true

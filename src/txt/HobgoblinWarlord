=========== Passives ============
Martial Advantage: Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 14 (4d6) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 ft of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn't incapacitated
Leadership (recharges after a short or long rest): As an action, for 1 minute, the hobgoblin can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 ft of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the hobgoblin. A creature that can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the hobgoblin is incapacitated
Parry: As a reaction, the hobgoblin adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so , the hobgoblin must see the attacker and be wielding a melee attack

Damage Immunities: fire, poison
Condition Immunities: poisoned
Devil's Sight: Magical darkness doesn't impede the devi's darkvision
Magic Resistance: The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects
Animate Chains (Recharges after a short or long rest): As an action, up to four chains the devil can see within 60 ft of it magically sprout razor-edged barbs and animate under the devil's control, provided that the chains aren't being worn or carried. Each animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When the devil uses Multiattack on its turn, it can uses each animated chain to make one additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one creature of its own but can't make attacks while grappling. An animated chain reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points or if the devil is incapacitated or dies
Unnerving Mask: As a reaction, when a creature the devil can see starts its turn within 30 ft of the devil, the devil can create the illusion that it looks like one of the creature's departed loved ones or bitter enemies. If the creature can see the devil, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its turn

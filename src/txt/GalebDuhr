============== Passives =============
Damage Resistances: bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons
Damage Immunities: poison
Condition Immunities: exhaustion, paralyzed, poisoned, petrified
False Appearance: While the galeb duhr remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal boulder
Rolling Charge: If the galeb duhr rolls at least 20 ft straight toward a target and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone
Animate Boulders (1/day): As an action, the galeb duhr magically animates up to two boulders it can see within 60 ft of it. A boulder has statistics like those of a galeb duhr, except it has Intelligence 1 and Charisma 1, it can't be charmed or frightened, and it lacks this ability. A bouler remains animated as long as the galeb duhr maintains concentration, up to 1 minute (as if concentrating on a spell)

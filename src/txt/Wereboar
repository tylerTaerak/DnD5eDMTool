Damage Immunities: bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons that aren't silvered
Shapechanger: The wereboar can use its action to polymorph into a boar-humanoid hybrid or into a boar, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC (which is 10 in humanoid form), are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. it reverts to its true form if it dies
Charge (boar or hybrid form only): If the wereboar moves at least 15 ft straight toward a target and then hits it with its tusks on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone
Relentless (recharges after a short or long rest): If the wereboar takes 14 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead
